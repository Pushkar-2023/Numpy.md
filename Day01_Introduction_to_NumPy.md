# 📘 What is NumPy?

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library used for numerical computing.
It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices along with a
collection of high-level mathematical functions.

## ✅ Why NumPy?
- Faster than Python lists
- Less memory consumption
- Vectorized operations
- Backbone of Data Science & Machine Learning

## 🔹 Key Features
- ndarray (N-dimensional array)
- Broadcasting
- Vectorized Operations
- Mathematical & Statistical functions
- Random number generation
- Integration with Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## 🔎 Simple Example

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(arr)
print(arr + 10)
